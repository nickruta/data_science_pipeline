# Data Science Pipeline
Test project to demonstrate all of the technologies needed to create an end-to-end data science pipeline. This includes consuming data from an original source, processing and storing it and finally demonstrating machine-learning based results to end users.

### Technologies Used

This data science pipeline consists of the following applications and services:

* [Twitter Stream Consumer] - Python-based consumtion of tweets using the tweepy library.
* [Flask Machine Learning Service](https://github.com/nickruta/data_science_pipeline/tree/master/Flask_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_Service/api) - Flask-based application to provide machine learning results.
